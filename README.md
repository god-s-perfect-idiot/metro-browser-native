# Metro Browser Native

Hi there! This is the repository for the Metro Browser Native project. This project is a part of the Metro Suite of projects, which is meant to serve as base applications for Metro OS (A custom Android ROM with the Metro UI Design Language).

This project is built using the [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) framework, and is meant to be a replacement for the default Android Browser. 
It uses React Webview to render webpages, and is meant to be a lightweight, fast, and secure browser.

## Building

To build this project, you will need to have the following installed:
1. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
3. [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or An Android Device with expo installed.
4. [Expo](https://expo.io/)
5. [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)


Once you have all of these installed, you can clone this repository and run `yarn install` to install all of the dependencies. 
Then, you can run `yarn start` to start the development server.

Alternatively, if you are a deranged person like me, you can use npm instead of yarn. To do this, run `npm install` to install all of the dependencies, and then run `npm start` to start the development server.

To launch the app on your device, you can use the Expo Go app, or you can use Android Studio to build the app and install it on your device.
You can reset the build by running `expo start --clear` or `npm start --clear` or `yarn start --clear`.
